# The Smallest Snake Game
It is my attempt to create the smallest snake game possible on windows. This game has been written in assembly (MASM) and uses Win32API library.

## Build instructions
1. You need to have masm32 installed. You can get it from [this](https://www.masm32.com) website.
    - Optionally you can build this program with Crinkler to achieve even smaller results. You can learn more and get it from [this](https://github.com/runestubbe/Crinkler) GitHub project.
2. You run the included build script and you're done.
    - To build with Crinkler, you need the Crinkler executable in the project folder.
